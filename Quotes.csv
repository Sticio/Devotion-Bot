3,Jonathan Edwards,"God is the highest good of the reasonable creature. The enjoyment of him is our proper; and is the only happiness with which our souls can be satisfied. To go to heaven, fully to enjoy God, is infinitely better than the most pleasant accommodations here. Better than fathers and mothers, husbands, wives, or children, or the company of any, or all earthly friends. These are but shadows; but the enjoyment of God is the substance. These are but scattered beams; but God is the sun. These are but streams; but God is the fountain. These are but drops, but God is the ocean."

22,St. Bede the Venerable,"Unfurl the sails, and let God steer us where He will."
23,Johann Gerhard,"I urge you with all sincerity that when you are truly contrite in your inmost heart for the sins you have committed, look to Him, who died for you on the altar of the Cross. He did this so that you would not be subject to eternal death. Turn your eyes from the outward appearance of death and place them on Christ who by His death has destroyed him who had the power of death, that is, the devil; And has delivered us who, through fear of death, were all our lifetime subject to bondage (Heb 2: 14– 15). He is the death of our death (Hos 13: 14); He is the sting to the Hell we deserved; He is the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Him, though he die, shall live; and everyone who lives and believes in Him shall never die (John 11: 25– 26)."

Never spend your time in such a way that you would not like to have God say, ""What are you doing?” "

43,John Owen,"It is not the glorious battlements, the painted windows, the crouching gargoyles that support a building, but the stones that lie unseen in or upon the earth. It is often those who are despised and trampled on that bear up the weight of a whole nation"
44,Charles Hodge,The doctrines of grace humble a man without degrading him and exalt a man without inflating him
45,J.I. Packer,"“Wait on the Lord"" is a constant refrain in the Psalms, and it is a necessary word, for God often keeps us waiting. He is not in such a hurry as we are, and it is not his way to give more light on the future than we need for action in the present, or to guide us more than one step at a time. When in doubt, do nothing, but continue to wait on God. When action is needed, light will come.”"

63,St. Augustine,"What does love look like?
It has the hands to help others.

That is what love looks like."

87,J.C. Ryle,"Beware of manufacturing a God of your own: a God who is all mercy, but not just; a God who is all love, but not holy; a God who has a heaven for every body, but a hell for none; a God who can allow good and bad to be side by side in time, but will make no distinction between good and broad in eternity. Such a God is an idol of your own, as truly an idol as any snake or crocodile in an Egyptian temple. The hands of your own fancy and sentimentality have made him. He is not the God of the Bible, and beside the God of the Bible there is no God at all."

"

100,St. Augustine,"Whereas, therefore, in every question, which relates to life and conduct, not only teaching, but exhortation also is necessary; in order that by teaching we may know what is to be done, and by exhortation may be incited not to think it irksome to do what we already know is to be done; what more can I teach you, than what we read in the Apostle? For holy Scripture setteth a rule to our teaching, that we dare not “be wise more than it behoveth to be wise; but be wise, as himself saith, “unto soberness, according as unto each God hath allotted the measure of faith.”Be it not therefore for me to teach you any other thing, save to expound to you the words of the Teacher, and to treat of them as the Lord shall have given to me."

105,St. Hippolytus,"heavenly light more brilliant than all others sheds its radiance everywhere, and he who was begotten before the morning star and all the stars of heaven, Christ, mighty and immortal, shines upon all creatures more brightly than the sun."
106,William Perkins,"Christian, show yourself to be a member of Christ and a servant of God, not only in the general calling of a Christian, but also in the particular calling in which you are placed. It is not enough for a magistrate to be a Christian man, but he must also be a Christian magistrate. It is not enough for a master of a family to be a Christian man or a Christian in the church, but he must also be a Christian in his family and in the trade which he follows daily. Not everyone who is a common hearer of the Word and a frequenter of the Lord’s Table is therefore a good Christian, unless his conversation in his private house and in his private affairs and dealings be suitable. There is a man to be seen what he is."

113,Isaac Watts,"The Great God values not the service of men, if the heart be not in it: The Lord sees and judges the heart; he has no regard to outward forms of worship, if there be no inward adoration, if no devout affection be employed therein. It is therefore a matter of infinite importance, to have the whole heart engaged steadfastly to God."
114,Henry Scougal,"The worth and excellency of a soul is to be measured by the object of its love. He who loveth mean and sordid things doth thereby become base and vile, but a noble and well-placed affection doth advance and improve the spirit into a conformity with the perfections which it loves."
115,Martin Luther,"Whatever your heart clings to and confides in, that is really your God"

124,J.C. Ryle,"There is a common, worldly kind of Christianity in this day, which many have, and think they have enough-a cheap Christianity which offends nobody, and requires no sacrifice-which costs nothing, and is worth nothing."
125,Charles Wesley,"Amazing Love! How can it be, That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?"
126,John Calvin,"There is not one blade of grass, there is no color in this world that is not intended to make us rejoice."

135,Hugh Latimer,"Saviour! teach me, day by day, Love's sweet lesson to obey; Sweeter lesson cannot be, Loving Him who first loved me. Charity is the very livery of Christ."
136,Josiah Shute,"Everyone, whether parents, masters, or rulers, should be obeyed only as far as their instructions align with God’s will. If we choose to ignore God’s commandments to please others, we risk facing judgment both in this world and the next."
137,John Knox,Let no day slip over without some comfort received from the mouth of God.
138,Wiilliam Perkins,"We must, in ourselves, be like the wounded man that lay in the road, that Christ Jesus the true Samaritan may come by us to dress our wounds, and to power his own precious blood into our souls."

My days are as grass, as a flower of the field; for the wind goeth over me, and I am gone, and my place shall know me no more."
146,Thomas Watson,"Great was the work of creation, but greater was the work of redemption. Great wisdom was seen in making us—but more miraculous wisdom in saving us. Great power was seen in bringing us out of nothing—but greater power in helping us when we were worse than nothing. (...) In the creation, God gave us ourselves; in the redemption, He gave us Himself."
147,Jonathan Edwards,"How can you expect to dwell with God forever, if you so neglect and forsake him here?"
148,Henry Scougal,"Christians know by experience that true religion is a union of the soul with God, a real participation in the divine nature, the very image of God drawn upon the soul, or, in the apostle's phrase, ""it is Christ formed within us""."
149,St. Ambrose,"When we speak about wisdom, we are speaking about Christ. When we speak about virtue, we are speaking about Christ. When we speak about justice, we are speaking about Christ.

159,Hugh Latimer,"As every lord giveth a certain livery to his servants, charity is the very livery of Christ. Our Saviour, Who is the Lord above all lords, would have His servants known their badge, which is love."
160,Martyn Lloyd-Jones,"If we believe that Jesus of Nazareth is the only begotten Son of God and that He came into this world and went to the cross of Calvary and died for our sins and rose again in order to justify us and to give us life anew and prepare us for heaven-if you really believe that, there is only one inevitable deduction, namely that He is entitled to the whole of our lives, without any limit whatsoever."

168,St. Columbanus,"God is everywhere in his immensity, and everywhere close at hand."
169,John Wesley,"In using all means, seek God alone. In and through every outward thing, look only to the power of His Spirit, and the merits of His Son. Beware you do not get stuck in the work itself; if you do, it is all lost labor. Nothing short of God can satisfy your soul. Therefore, fix on Him in all, through all, and above all...Remember also to use all means as means-as ordained, not for their own sake…"
170,Fyodor Dostoevsky,To love someone means to see them as God intended them.
171,St. Clement,"Where can one go, where can one escape to, from the presence of Him whose hands embrace the universe?"
172,Jonathan Edwards,"Seek not to grow in knowledge chiefly for the sake of applause, and to enable you to dispute with others; but seek it for the benefit of your souls."
173,St. Basil The Great,"What, I ask, is more wonderful than the beauty of God?"
174,Lancelot Andrewes,"I am ever Thine. If Thou cast me out, who shall take me in? If Thou disregard me, who shall look on me? More canst Thou remit, than I commit; more canst Thou spare, than I offend. Let not hurtful pleasures overcome me; at the least let not any perverse habit overwhelm me; From evil and unlawful desires; From vain, hurtful, impure imaginations; from the illusions of evil spirits; from pollutions of soul and of body; Good Lord, deliver me."
175,Thomas Hooker,"We abide in Christ when the eye is fixed upon Christ, when the tongue continually speaks of Christ, when the mind dwells on him, and when the affections are directed towards him. But when the mind is taken off the promise and the comforts found therein, amusing itself by thinking of temptations or inward corruptions, then we are overcome"
176,St. Augustine,"Every creature is God’s servant, for it was through him that every creature came to be."
177,Matthew Henry,"Take Jesus for your king, and by baptism swear allegiance to him; take him for your prophet, and hear him; take him for your priest, to make atonement for you."
178,St. Cyprian,"With Christ’s help, we who live and abide in him will never be separated from his body and his grace."
179,Josiah Shute,"The sin of pride is so ingrained in us that even when other sins decrease, pride grows."
180,St. Irenaeus,"Thus, then, they who are of faith shall be blessed with faithful Abraham, and these are the children of Abraham. Now God made promise of the earth to Abraham and his seed; yet neither Abraham nor his seed, that is, those who are justified by faith, do now receive any inheritance in it; but they shall receive it at the resurrection of the just. For God is true and faithful; and on this account He said, “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.”"
181,Martin Luther,We need to hear the Gospel every day because we forget it every day.
182,John Calvin,We shall never be clothed with the righteousness of Christ except that we first know assuredly that we have no righteousness of our own.
183,Henry Scougal,"The true way to improve and ennoble our souls is, by fixing our love on the divine perfections, that we may have them always before us, and derive an impression of them on ourselves; and, ""beholding with open face, as in a glass, the glory of the Lord, we may be changed into the same image, from glory to glory."
184,William Tyndale,"God's goodness is the root of all goodness, and our goodness, if we have any, springs out of His goodness."
185,John Jewel,"But the law of God came from heaven indeed. God wrote it with his finger, it is the fountain of all wisdom, and therefore shall it continue for ever, and never have an end."
186,John Calvin,"We should ask God to increase our hope when it is small, awaken it when it is dormant, confirm it when it is wavering, strengthen it when it is weak, and raise it up when it is overthrown."
187,Peter Martyr Vermigli,In every idolatry the devil is worshipped.
188,St. John Chrysostom,"But after saying that ‘it was excluded,’ he shows also, how. How then does he say it was excluded? ‘By what law? of works? Nay, but by the law of faith.’ See he calls the faith also a law delighting to keep to the names, and so allay the seeming novelty. But what is the ‘law of faith?’ It is, being saved by grace. Here he shows God’s power, in that He has not only saved, but has even justified, and led them to boasting, and this too without needing works, but looking for faith only."
189,Martyn Lloyd-Jones,"The terrible, tragic fallacy of the last hundred years has been to think that all man's troubles are due to his environment, and that to change the man you have nothing to do but change his environment. That is a tragic fallacy. It overlooks the fact that it was in Paradise that man fell."
190,David Clarkson,"Men use this to excuse their sin, “it is my nature”; yet this is the greatest aggravation of it. Would this be a good plea for one who has plotted treason, to say, I am naturally a traitor; it is my nature to be treacherous, murderous?"
191,Henry Scougal,"[Love, basically, is love of God]: a delightful and affectionate sense of the divine perfections, which makes the soul resign and sacrifice itself wholly unto him, desiring above all things to please him, and delighting in nothing so much as in fellowship and communion with him, and being ready to do or suffer anything for his sake, or at his pleasure ... A soul thus possessed with divine love must needs be enlarged towards all mankind ... this is ... charity ... under which all parts of justice, all the duties we owe to our neighbour, are eminently comprehended; for he who doth truly love all the world ... so far from wrongdoing or injuring any person ... will resent any evil that befalls others, as if it happened to himself."
192,Jonathan Edwards,He who loves God will love Holiness and hate sin.
193,Herman Bavinck,"The Gospel is sheer good tidings, not demand but promise, not duty but gift. But in order that as promise and gift it may be realized in us, it takes on the character of moral admonishment in accordance with our nature. It does not want to force us, but it wants nothing other than that we freely and willingly accept in faith what God wants to give us. The will of God realizes itself in no other way than through our reason and will. That is why it is rightly said that a person, by the grace He receives, himself believes and himself turns from sin to God."
194,St. Justin Martyr,"For Abraham was declared by God to be righteous, not on account of circumcision, but on account of faith. For before he was circumcised the following statement was made regarding him: ‘Abraham believed God, and it was accounted unto him for righteousness.'"
195,Charles Spurgeon,"If you had God’s praise in your mouths, you would not criticize others so often."
196,Jan Hus,"I hope, by God's grace, that I am truly a Christian, not deviating from the faith, and that I would rather suffer the penalty of a terrible death than wish to affirm anything outside of the faith or transgress the commandments of our Lord Jesus Christ."
197,John Bunyan,"Christ is the desire of nations, the joy of angels, the delight of the Father. What solace then must that soul be filled with, that has the possession of Him to all eternity!"
198,Martin Luther,The Bible is the cradle wherein Christ is laid.
199,Thomas Brooks,"It is not hasty reading, but serious meditation on holy and heavenly truths, that makes them prove sweet and profitable to the soul. It is not he that reads most, but he that meditates most, that will prove to be the sweetest, wisest and strongest Christian. "
200,George Whitefield,"If you say you are the chief of sinners, I answer that will be no hindrance to your salvation. Indeed it will not, if you lay hold on Christ by faith. Read the Evangelists, and see how kindly he behaved to his disciples, who had fled from and denied him. ‘Go, tell my brethren,’ says he. He did not say, ‘Go, tell those traitors,’ but, ‘Go, tell my brethren and Peter.’ It is as though he had said, ‘Go, tell my brethren in general, and Peter in particular, that I am risen. Oh, comfort his poor drooping heart. Tell him I am reconciled to him. Bid him weep no more so bitterly. For though with oaths and curses he thrice denied me, yet I have died for his sins; I have risen again for his justification: I freely forgive him all.” Thus slow to anger and of great kindness, was our all-merciful High Priest. And do you think he has changed his nature and forgets poor sinners, now he is exalted to the right hand of God? No; he is the same yesterday, today, and forever; and sitteth there only to make intercession for"
201,St. Anselm,"Oh God, let me know you and love you so that I may find my joy in you."
202,August Hermann Francke,"Show them that it requires no great art and skill to pray acceptably unto God; for they are to speak to him as children to a loving father, they are to spread before him their sorrows and complaints, they are to tell him of the state and condition of their souls, just as they find and feel it; and they need not be at all solicitous about propriety of expression and elegant phrases in their secret prayers; for God regards the sense of the heart, rather than the language of the lips."
203,Thomas Hooker,"He that thus walks with Christ here, shall live with him forever hereafter."
204,Nicholas Lockyer,Sincerity encompasses more than merely praising holiness. It involves actively striving for holiness.
205,Thomas Brooks,"Saving grace makes a man as willing to leave his lusts as a slave is willing to leave his galley, or a prisoner his dungeon, or a thief his bolts, or a beggar his rags."
206,Thomas Watson,"The pleasure of sin is soon gone, but the sting remains."
207,Martin Luther,"We do not become righteous by doing righteous deeds but, having been made righteous, we do righteous deeds."
208,Matthew Henry,The fear of God reigning in the heart is the beauty of the soul.
209,Fyodor Dostoevsky,"All writers, not ours alone but foreigners also, who have sought to represent Absolute Beauty, were unequal to the task, for it is an infinitely difficult one. … There is in the world only one figure of absolute beauty: Christ. That infinitely lovely figure is, as a matter of course, an infinite marvel."
210,Charles Spurgeon,Unbelief will destroy the best of us. Faith will save the worst of us.
211,John Calvin,You must submit to supreme suffering in order to discover the completion of joy.
212,St. Basil The Great,What words can adequately describe God’s gifts? They are so numerous that they defy enumeration. They are so great that any one of them demands our total gratitude in response.
213,St. Augustine,"Man sinned and became guilty. Man fell, but God descended; man fell miserably, but God descended mercifully; man fell through pride, God descended with his grace."
214,Jonathan Edwards,Godliness is more easily feigned in words than in actions
215,John Flavel,Paul had one foot in heaven when he called himself the chiefest of sinners and least of saints.
216,Josiah Shute,"One might spend everything to be cured, as did the woman in the Gospel with the issue of blood, yet unless God wills it, it will do no good. Saul might go to the Witch of Endor for help, and Amaziah to the god of Ekron to be healed, but unless the God of heaven works the cure, it will never be done."
217,William Tyndale,"Expound the Law truly, and open the veil of Moses to condemn all flesh and prove all men sinners, and set at broach the mercy of our Lord Jesus, and let the wounded consciences drink of Him."
218,Herman Bavinck,"The Holy Spirit does not, after the act of inspiration, withdraw from Holy Scripture and abandon it to its fate but sustains and animates it and in many ways brings its content to humanity, to its heart and conscience."
219,St. Augustine,"We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: and He is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also [for those] of the whole world.” The whole world then is the Church, and yet the whole world hates the Church."
220,Peter Martyr Vermigli,"The world, when it does not feel Christ in itself and does not experience his joy and peace, thinks it madness to rejoice amid tribulations."
221,Fyodor Dostoevsky,"My friends, God is necessary for me if only because he is the one being who can be loved eternally."
222,T.S. Elliot,Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?
223,Jonathan Edwards,"A truly Christian love, either to God or men, is a humble broken-hearted love. The desires of the saints, however earnest, are humble desires. Their hope is a humble hope; and their joy, even when it is unspeakable and full of glory, is a humble broken-hearted joy, and leaves the Christian more poor in spirit, and more like a little child, and more disposed to a universal lowliness of behaviour."
224,John Bunyan,"I saw that I needed a perfect righteousness to present me without fault before God, and this righteousness was nowhere to be found but in the person of Jesus Christ."
225,F.F. Bruce,"The soul’s deepest thirst is for God Himself, who has made us so that we can never be satisfied without Him."
226,Charles Wesley,"Faith, mighty faith, the promise sees, And looks to God alone; Laughs at impossibilities, And cries it shall be done."
227,David Brainerd,"Give yourself to prayer, to reading and meditation on divine truths: strive to penetrate to the bottom of them and never be content with a superficial knowledge."
228,St. Clement,"Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will not impute to him, and in whose mouth there is no guile. This blessedness comes upon those who have been chosen by God through Jesus Christ our Lord; to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen."
229,Richard Baxter,"This life was not intended to be the place of our perfection, but the preparation for it."
230,Martyn Lloyd-Jones,"I will not glory, even in my orthodoxy, for even that can be a snare if I make a god of it... Let us rejoice in Him in all His fulness and in Him alone."
231,John Jewel,"The word of God is full of sad and grave counsel, full of the knowledge of God, of examples of virtues, and of correction of vices, of the end of this life, and of the life to come."
232,Leonard Ravenhill,Lord strengthen me where I am too weak and weaken me where I am too strong!
233,Archibald Alexander,"No one was ever saved because his sins were small; no one was ever rejected on account of the greatness of his sins. Where sin abounded, grace shall much more abound."
234,Lancelot Andrewes,"The Lord is my strength, my strong rock, my defense, my deliverer, the horn of my salvation, and my refuge. Amen."
235,Herman Bavinck,"The Christian religion was, therefore, preeminently for the poor, the simple, plebeians, slaves, and the sick. Christians, having themselves received compassion, had compassion on others."
236,Charles Spurgeon,The Lord gets his best soldiers out of the highlands of affliction.
237,Thomas Watson,"Until sin be bitter, Christ will not be sweet."
238,John Owen,There is no death of sin without the death of Christ.
239,John Calvin,"The gospel is not a doctrine of the tongue, but of life. It cannot be grasped by reason and memory only, but it is fully understood when it possesses the whole soul and penetrates to the inner recesses of the heart."
240,Hannah More,"There is one single fact that one may oppose to all the wit and argument of infidelity; namely, that no man ever repented of being a Christian on his deathbed."
241,St. Ambrose,"Do not trust in riches; for all such things are left here, faith alone will accompany you. And righteousness indeed will go with you if faith has led the way. Why do riches entice you? “Ye were not redeemed with gold and silver,” with possessions, or silk garments, “from your vain conversation, but with the precious Blood of Christ. ” He then is rich who is an heir of God, a joint heir with Christ. Despise not the poor man, he has made you rich. ” This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him.” Do not reject a poor man, Christ when He was rich became poor, and became poor because of you, that by His poverty He might make you rich. Do not then as though rich exalt yourself, He sent forth His apostles without money"
242,Charles Simeon,What can be more deplorable than to be a slave of sin? What can be more truly blessed than to have all our actions and affections corresponding with the Word of God? Surely this is a ground of satisfaction. 
243,Martin Luther,"If he have faith, the believer cannot be restrained. He betrays himself. He breaks out. He confesses and teaches this gospel to the people at the risk of life itself."
244,Charles Hodge,"It is those who look to Christ, not only for pardon but for holiness, that are successful in subduing sin, while the legalist remains its slave. "
245,John Bunyan,No child of God sins to that degree as to make himself incapable of forgiveness.
246,Thomas Watson,Eternity to the godly is a day that has no sunset; eternity to the wicked is a night that has no sunrise.
247,F.F. Bruce,"The evidence for our New Testament writings is ever so much greater than the evidence for many writings of classical authors, the authenticity of which no-one dreams of questioning."
248,Jonathan Edwards,Nothing sets a Christian so much out of the devil's reach than humility.
249,Peter Martyr Vermigli,"For the stronger the faith, and the better God is perceived through it, the more love is inflamed toward its goal; so that the end and, as they say, the object of faith prescribes love, and love of your neighbor is as deep as your faith in God."
250,Jeremy Taylor,"Do not think that God is only to be found in a great prayer, or a solemn office: he is moved by a sigh, by a groan, by an act of love; and therefore, when your pain is great and pungent, lay all your strength upon it."
251,John Calvin,The surest source of destruction to men is to obey themselves.
252,Jan Hus,"In life eternal, there is perfect joy and light, without pain or torture, and there is communion with God Himself and His angels."
253,Charles Wesley,"To God your every Want In instant Prayer display, Pray always; Pray, and never faint; Pray, without ceasing, Pray."
254,Herman Bavinck,There is not an atom of the universe in which God’s power and divinity are not revealed.
255,John Wesley,"I want to know one thing, the way to heaven; how to land safe on that happy shore. God Himself has condescended to teach the way; for this end He came from heaven. He hath written it down in a book. Give me that book! At any price give me the Book of God"
256,Martin Luther,The gospel cannot be truly preached without offense and tumult.
257,August Hermann Francke,"It would further be useful, and it is highly necessary, that ministers should not only preach up the necessity of conversion, and instruct their hearers to depend on the grace of Christ for it, but also that they should, very frequently, in their sermons explain the nature and the whole progress of conversion, sometimes more largely and distinctly, and at other times more briefly, endeavoring thereby to lead their hearers into a true knowledge of the state of their souls; and showing them how they must repent of their sins, what they must do to be saved from their natural misery and ruin, and, in short, how they may obtain the full salvation of the gospel; that so every one may be able to give an answer to that most important question, 'What must I do that I may be a child of God and inherit eternal life?"
258,Charles Spurgeon,You cannot sin as much as God can forgive.
259,T.S. Elliot,"The endless cycle of idea and action, endless invention, endless experiment, brings knowledge of motion, but not of stillness; knowledge of speech, but not of silence; knowledge of words, and ignorance of the Word."
260,George Whitefield,"I go to a rest prepared; my sun has arisen, and by aid from Heaven has given light to many. It is now about to set - no, it is about to rise to the zenith of immortal glory. Many may outlive me on earth, but they cannot outlive me in Heaven. Oh, thought divine! I shall soon be in a world where time, age, pain and sorrow are unknown. My body fails, my spirit expands. How willingly would I live to preach Christ! But I die to be with him!"
261,Thomas Brooks,"It is only an infinite God, and an infinite good, that can fill and satisfy the precious and immortal soul of man."
262,St. Polycarp,"by grace ye are saved, not of works,’ but by the will of God through Jesus Christ . . . If we please Him in this present world, we shall receive also the future world, according as He has promised to us that He will raise us again from the dead, and that if we live worthily of Him, ‘we shall also reign together with Him,’ provided only we believe…"
263,David Brainerd,"I never got away from Jesus, and Him crucified, and I found that when my people were gripped by this great evangelical doctrine of Christ and Him crucified, I had no need to give them instructions about morality.  "
264,Martyn Lloyd-Jones,How easy it is to read the Scriptures and give a kind of nominal assent to the truth and yet never to appropriate what it tells us!
265,Thomas Watson,"It was wonderful love that Christ should rather die for us than for the angels that fell. They were creatures of a more noble extract, and in all probability might have brought greater revenues of glory to God; yet that Christ should pass by those golden vessels, and make us clods of earth into stars of glory -- Oh, the hyperbole of Christ's love!"
266,John Calvin,"Faith is like an empty, open hand stretched out toward God, with nothing to offer and everything to receive."
267,John Bunyan,"Afflictions make the heart more deep, more knowing and profound, and so, more able to hold, to contain, and beat more."
268,Matthew Henry,"The Christian religion is the religion of sinners, of such as have sinned, and in whom sin in some measure still dwells. The Christian life is a life of continued repentance, humiliation for and mortification of sin, of continual faith in, thankfulness for, and love to the Redeemer, and hopeful joyful expectation of a day of glorious redemption, in which the believer shall be fully and finally acquitted, and sin abolished for ever."
269,F.F. Bruce,Any part of the human body can only be properly explained in reference to the whole body. And any part of the Bible can only be properly explained in reference to the whole Bible.
270,Fyodor Dostoevsky,"How dreadfully has it tormented me (and torments me even now) this longing for faith, which is all the stronger for the proofs I have against it. And yet God gives me sometimes moments of perfect peace; in such moments I love and believe that I am loved; in such moments I have formulated my creed, wherein all is clear and holy to me."
271,John Jewel,"in the Lord’s Supper there is truly given unto the believing the body and blood of the Lord, the flesh of the Son of God, which quickeneth our souls, the meat that cometh from above, the food of immortality, grace, truth, and life, and the Supper to be the communion of the body and blood of Christ; by the partaking whereof we be revived, we be strengthened, and be fed unto immortality; and whereby we are joined, united, and incorporate unto Christ, that we may abide in Him, and He in us."
272,St. John Chrysostom,"Furthermore, discoursing with others, he even calls the thing a free gift, saying, “It hath been granted in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer in His behalf.” "
273,Thomas Brooks,"God has in Himself all power to defend you, all wisdom to direct you, all mercy to pardon you, all grace to enrich you, all righteousness to clothe you, all goodness to supply you, and all happiness to crown you."
274,Richard Baxter,"Every time we look upon our congregations, let us believingly remember that they are the purchase of Christ’s blood, and therefore should be regarded by us with the deepest interest and the most tender affection."
275,William Tyndale,"To have a faith, therefore, or a trust in anything where God has not promised is plain idolatry and a worshipping of your own imagination instead of God."
276,John Calvin,So great and boundless is God's wisdom that he knows right well how to use evil instruments to do good.
277,Martin Luther,"The Bible is a remarkable fountain: The more one draws and drinks of it, the more it stimulates thirst."
278,John Owen,"To suppose that whatever God requires of us that we have power of ourselves to do, is to make the cross and grace of Jesus Christ of none effect."
279,Thomas Boston,"Believing, repenting, and the like, are the product of the new nature; and can never be produced by the old corrupt nature. The heart is shut against Christ: man cannot open it, only God can do it by his grace."
280,Jonathan Edwards,"If the heart be chiefly and directly fixed on God, and the soul engaged to glorify him, some degree of religious affection will be the effect and attendant of it. But to seek after affection directly and chiefly; to have the heart principally set upon that; is to place it in the room of God and his glory. If it be sought, that others may take notice of it, and admire us for our spirituality and forwardness in religion, it is then damnable pride; if for the sake of feeling the pleasure of being affected, it is then idolatry and self-gratification."
281,Peter Martyr Vermigli,Calling is never offered to us by God on account of our works or merits.
282,Herman Bavinck,"Christ is most unlike other religious leaders because he is not the founder of Christianity, nor the first confessor of it, nor the first Christian. Rather, he is Christianity itself, in its preparation, fulfilment, and consummation."
283,John Flavel,"The Scriptures teach us the best way of living, the noblest way of suffering and the most comfortable way of dying."
284,St. Theodoret,And to me our master Christ hath granted the boon “not only of believing on Him but also of suffering for His sake.
285,Charles Spurgeon,"Christ will reign over you, either by your consent, or without it."
286,John Bunyan,"You can do more than pray after you have prayed, but you cannot do more than pray until you have prayed. Pray often, for prayer is a shield to the soul, a sacrifice to God, and a scourge to Satan."
287,F.F. Bruce,God is the archetypal Father; all other fatherhood is a more or less imperfect copy of his perfect fatherhood. 
288,John Calvin,"Our prayer must not be self-centered. It must arise not only because we feel our own need as a burden we must lay upon God, but also because we are so bound up in love for our fellow men that we feel their need as acutely as our own. To make intercession for men is the most powerful and practical way in which we can express our love for them. "
289,St. Basil The Great,The radiance of the divine beauty is altogether beyond the power of words to describe.
290,Thomas Brooks,"A man’s most glorious actions will at last be found to be but glorious sins, if he has made himself, and not the glory of God, the end of those actions."
291,Thomas Watson,"We pray, 'lead us not into temptation'. Do we then lead ourselves into temptation?"
292,John Owen,"Temptations and occasions put nothing into a man, but only draw out what was in him before."
293,Fyodor Dostoevsky,"God has such gladness every time he sees from heaven that a sinner is praying to Him with all his heart, as a mother has when she sees the first smile on her baby’s face."
294,Martyn Lloyd-Jones,"I am profoundly grateful to God that He did not grant me certain things for which I asked, and that He shut certain doors in my face."
295,John Jewel,"True faith is lively, and can in no wise be idle"
296,Charles Spurgeon,"Visit many good books, but live in the Bible."
297,St. Irenaeus,"’And dipped himself,’ says [the Scripture], ‘seven times in Jordan.’ It was not for nothing that Naaman of old, when suffering from leprosy, was purified upon his being baptized, but it served as an indication to us. For as we are lepers in sin, we are made clean, by means of the sacred water and the invocation of the Lord, from our old transgressions; being spiritually regenerated as new-born babes, even as the Lord has declared: ‘Except a man be born again through water and the Spirit, he shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.'"
298,David Brainerd,"I have ever found that when I have thought the battle was over and the conquest gained, and so let down my watch, the enemy has risen up and done me the greatest injury."
299,F.F. Bruce,"Persistence in prayer for someone whom we don’t like (Lk. 6:28), however much it goes against the grain to begin with, brings about a remarkable change in attitude."
300,Johann Gerhard,"The smallest spark of faith is the work of the Holy Spirit because by ourselves and from ourselves we are not able to think even something good. Indeed, to will and to do is from God."
301,St. Augustine,"The Lord of hosts is himself the king of glory. He will transform us and show us his face, and we shall be saved; all our longing will be fulfilled, all our desires will be satisfied."
302,Herman Bavinck,"Where God’s Word is, there is God Himself, there God’s Spirit is at work, there God establishes His covenant, there He plants His church."
303,Matthew Henry,"Cast not away your confidence because God defers his performances. That which does not come in your time, will be hastened in his time, which is always the more convenient season. God will work when he pleases, how he pleases, and by what means he pleases. He is not bound to keep our time, but he will perform his work, honor our faith, and reward them that diligently seek him."
304,Peter Martyr Vermigli,"Moses led the people to the promised land as to the port of all the labors he had undertaken, so the divine Scriptures open the way to believers to supreme happiness and teach them the statements of doctrine and the precepts of morality, which... Paul calls a beautiful deposit."
305,John Calvin,Peace is not to be purchased by the sacrifice of truth.
306,Thomas Brooks,"God’s hearing of our prayers does not depend upon sanctification, but upon Christ’s intercession; not upon what we are in ourselves, but what we are in the Lord Jesus "
307,Fyodor Dostoevsky,"If it were not for Christ’s Church, indeed there would be no restraint on the criminal in his evildoing… If anything protects society even in our time, and even reforms the criminal himself and transforms him into a different person, again it is Christ’s law alone, which manifests itself in the acknowledgement of one’s own conscience."
308,Jeremy Taylor,"I acknowledge, dear God, that I have deserved the greatest of thy wrath and indignation; and that, if thou hadst dealt with me according to my deserving, I had now, at this instant, been desperately bewailing my miseries in the sorrows and horrors of a sad eternity. But thy mercy triumphing over thy justice and my sins, thou hast still continued to me life and time of repentance; thou hast opened to me the gates of grace and mercy, and perpetually callest upon me to enter in, and to walk in the paths of a holy life, that I might glorify thee, and be glorified of thee eternally."
309,John Bunyan,"Weep not for me, but for yourselves. I go to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who will through the mediation of His blessed son receive me though a sinner; there we shall meet to sing the new song and remain everlasting happy, world without end."
310,Martyn Lloyd-Jones,"[The] term ‘decide’ has always seemed to me to be quite wrong…A sinner does not ‘decide’ for Christ; the sinner ‘flies’ to Christ in utter helplessness and despair saying —
Foul, I to the fountain fly,
Wash me, Saviour, or I die.
No man truly comes to Christ unless he flies to Him as his only refuge and hope, his only way of escape from the accusations of conscience and the condemnation of God’s holy law. Nothing else is satisfactory. If a man says that having thought about the matter and having considered all sides he has on the whole decided for Christ, and if he has done so without any emotion or feeling, I cannot regard him as a man who has been regenerated. The convicted sinner no more ‘decides’ for Christ than the poor drowning man ‘decides’ to take hold of that rope that is thrown to him and suddenly provides him with the only means of escape. The term is entirely inappropriate."
311,John Wesley,Untold millions are still untold.
312,John Owen,"We have so much of the Pharisee in us by nature, that it is sometimes well that our good is hid from us. It is a good life which is with a faith of righteousness and a sense of corruption. While I know Christ’s righteousness, I shall less care to know my own holiness."
313,St. Gregory of Nazianzus,"O Light that knew no dawn, that shines to endless day, all things on earth and Heaven are lustered by thy ray; no eye can to thy throne ascend, nor mind thy brightness comprehend. "

Though Christian fortitude appears in withstanding and counteracting the enemies that are without us; yet it much more appears in resisting and suppressing the enemies that are within us; because they are our worst and strongest enemies and have greatest advantage against us. The strength of the good soldier of Jesus Christ appears in nothing more than in steadfastly maintaining the holy calm, meekness, sweetness, and benevolence of his mind, amidst all the storms, injuries, strange behaviour, and surprising acts and events of this evil and unreasonable world."
318,John Calvin,"men are undoubtedly more in danger from prosperity than from adversity. for when matters go smoothly, they flatter themselves, and are intoxicated by their success"

320,George Hutcheson,"Even true disciples may be such infants in knowledge that for a long time they will not understand much of what Christ said, for it was a long while before the disciples understood the meaning of this passage. [John 2:22.]"
321,Thomas Brooks,"Satan promises the best, but pays with the worst; he promises honour, and pays with disgrace; he promises pleasure, and pays with pain; he promises life, and pays with death. But God pays as He promises; all His payments are made in pure gold."
322,Daniel Dyke,"Comfort is often closest to us just when our afflictions are most severe. God works by contraries. At the creation, light out of darkness. In redemption, life out of death, glory out of shame, the blind man’s sight out of clay and spit — indeed, Heaven out of Hell. "
323,Thomas Watson,"Unless we deny our own will, we shall never do God’s will."
324,Johannes Wigand,"Paul does not set himself up above others, even though they did not have a calling of equal greatness. He goes on to show that the members of the church are all bound together by the strongest ties and that all those who believe in Christ are brothers. "
325,St. Cyril,Your accumulated offences do not surpass the multitude of God's mercies: your wounds do not surpass the great Physician's skill.

328,Martin Luther,"But we believers in Christ—God be praised!—are different people. We have come forth from death; we have passed through death and entered into life through the knowledge and faith of the Son of God, who has loved us and given himself for us. "
329,John Jewel,"We say also, that every person is born in sin, and leadeth his life in sin: that nobody is able truly to say his heart is clean: that the most righteous person is but an unprofitable servant: that the law of God is perfect, and requireth of us perfect and full obedience: that we are able by no means to fulfill that law in this worldly life: that there is no one mortal creature which can be justified by his own deserts in God’s sight: and therefore that our only succour and refuge is to fly to the mercy of our Father by Jesus Christ, and assuredly to persuade our minds that He is the obtainer of forgiveness for our sins; and that by His blood all our spots of sin be washed clean."

334,Martyn Lloyd-Jones,"To love to preach is one thing, to love those to whom we preach quite another."
335,Johann Gerhard,"You must learn from these temptations how you have absolutely no power in yourself to do what is good, so you might cleave completely to God alone with a faithful heart.

342,Daniel Dyke,"It may seem strange that Christ, just as he begins to provide wine, first orders them to fetch water. What poor comfort this was to call for water when they were all hoping for wine. And yet, wine was close at hand "
343,Thomas Watson,Men could be content to have the kingdom of heaven; but they are loathe to fight for it. They choose rather to go in a feather bed to hell than to be carried to heaven in a ‘fiery chariot’ of zeal and violence.

353,Martyn Lloyd-Jones,"It is very foolish to ignore the past.

354,Martin Bucer,"God alone is good, and everything that is true and right and good is his work alone. "
355,John Gwyn-Thomas,"Our thoughts express what we really are. We are what we think. We can easily deceive other people by our actions; we can be hypocritical in word and deed, but not in thought. Proverbs 23:7 tells us that the thoughts of our hearts reveal what we are. "
356,Johannes Bugenhagen,The Lord is near. Do not worry: he will supply you with all things. Do not be anxious. Desire no more than what you have.

358,Stephen Charnock,All goodness delights to communicate itself. Infinite goodness has then an infinite delight in expressing itself; it is a part of God’s goodness not to be weary of showing it. God can never then be weary of petitions for the effusions of it.
359,J.C. Ryle,"But, reader, how many of those who keep Christmas ever consider why Christmas is kept? How many, in their Christmas plans and arrangements, give a thought to Him, without whom there would have been no Christmas at all?

How many ever reflect that the first intention of Christmas was to remind Christians of Christ's birth and coming into the world? Reader, how is it with you? What do you think of at Christmas?"

364,Thomas Watson,"Better is that sin which humbles me, than that duty which makes me proud."
365,Francis Turretin,"The Scriptures may have various and ambiguous senses, not from the nature of the thing affirmed or the intention of the affirmer, but from the unskillfulness or obstinacy of the distorter. Therefore this ambiguity and obscurity (if such there is) does not take away their authority, but shows the necessity of the Spirit of illumination and of the minister to explain them."
